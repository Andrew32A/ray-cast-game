# Ray Cast Game
Inspired by old school games like Wolfenstein, I created a demo using ray casting!

## How To Play:
In this game, you are a player trying to avoid an enemy. If the enemy touches you, the game is over. You can freeze the enemy by looking at it, but you'll gain points by looking away from it.

## To play the game, use the following controls:

WASD - Move </br>
Mouse - Camera angle </br>
Q - Toggle minimap </br>

## To run the game locally, you'll need to clone this repository and run the following commands:

``` mySQL
npm install
npm start
```

## Fetures I'd like to add:
- Perspective correct texture mapping
- Flashlight mechanic that uses batteries spawned randomly in the map
- Enemy polygons
- More levels
