# Ray Cast Game:
I was inspired by classic games like Wolfenstein to create my own demo using ray casting technology. It was a challenging and time-consuming process that required countless hours of research and experimentation, but I eventually managed to piece together a basic game that showcases the power of this technique. Using ray casting, I was able to create a unique 2.5D world that is both immersive and engaging to explore. 

Despite encountering many obstacles and setbacks, I was determined to see the project through to completion, and I'm proud of what I've achieved. If you're a fan of old school games or simply looking for a new and exciting gaming experience, I invite you to try out my Ray Cast Game and immerse yourself in its captivating world!

## How To Play:
In this game, you are a player trying to avoid an enemy. If the enemy touches you, the game is over. You can freeze the enemy by looking at it, but you'll gain points by looking away from it.

## To play the game, use the following controls:

- WASD - Move </br>
- Mouse - Camera angle </br>
- Q - Toggle minimap </br>

## To run the game locally, you'll need to clone this repository and run the following commands:

``` mySQL
npm install
npm start
```

## Fetures I'd like to add and TODO list:
- Perspective correct texture mapping
- Flashlight mechanic that uses batteries spawned randomly in the map
- Enemy polygons
- More levels
- Mechanic where if the player looks at the enemy too long it'll trigger a game over
- Fix performance bug on certain devices
